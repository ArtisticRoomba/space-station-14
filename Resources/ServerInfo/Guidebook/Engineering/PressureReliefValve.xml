  # Pressure Relief Valve
  The Pressure Relief Valve is a passive device that allows gas to escape from a [textlink="pipenet" link="PipeNetworks"] when the pressure exceeds a certain threshold.

  ## Operation
  The valve will automatically [color=green]open[/color] when the pressure in the pipe exceeds the set threshold, allowing gas to escape to the connected output pipe.

  The valve will [color=red]close[/color] again when the pressure drops below the set threshold.

  The flow rate of the valve is limited to [color=orange][protodata="GasPressureReliefValve" comp="GasPressureReliefValve" member="MaxTransferRate"/] L/S[/color].

  ## Example Uses
  The valve is commonly used to prevent overpressure situations in gas systems, such as [textlink="TEG" link="TEG"] cooling loops and [textlink="pipes" link="Pipes"], which would cause a failure in the system (clogged [textlink="pumps" link="Pumps"]).

  The valve can also be used to vent off ready-to-use, hot gas from a burn chamber.
  For example, it may be undesirable to allow a burn chamber to drop below a specific pressure for a long time, as this may cause the gas to cool down too much and thin out, which would cause a flameout.

  A pressure relief valve can be used to vent off excess gas, while keeping the pressure in the burn chamber above a certain threshold, which may help in sustaining a fire in the chamber.
